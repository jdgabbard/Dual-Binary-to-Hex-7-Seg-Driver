# Dual-Binary-to-Hex-7-Seg-Driver
Display Hexadecimal Numbers from Binary Inputs on 7-Segment Displays

This repository is a clone from my original SourceForge upload.  It's intent is to consolidate repositories on GitHub, and be more readily available with my other projects.

The JEDEC and Source for both a Dual 7-Segment Hexadecimal and a Single 7-Segment Hexadecimal Display Driver using GAL22V10 and GAL16V8 PLDs. The driver uses a clocked input to multiplex the displays, so that one display is lit when the clock is high, and the other when the clock is low. With a fast enough clock speed the two displays both appear to be displayed at the same time.

The code is written for WinCUPL. See the Instructables page for more details.
